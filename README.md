This is a demo of the react-admin library for React.js. It creates a working administration for a fake poster shop named Posters Galore. You can test it online at https://marmelab.com/react-admin-demo.

React-admin usually requires a REST server to provide data. In this demo however, the REST server is simulated by the browser (using FakeRest).

The source code is available in the main marmelab/react-admin repository, under examples/demo/. To explore it, start with src/index.js.

This repository only contains the compiled code served by the GitHub CDN at https://marmelab.com/admin-on-rest-demo. You can find this production code in the gh-pages branch of this repository.
